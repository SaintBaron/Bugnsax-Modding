<h1>Background</h1>
<h2>Game Engine</h2>
Bugsnax uses the <a href="https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/">Irrlicht Engine</a>, an "open source realtime 3D engine written in C++". You can find out more about this engine in the link before. 

<h2>Common File Types</h2>
<b>.XML [Text]</b> - XML files contain the XML language. This is a markup language without predefined tags. Whilst commonly used for data storage, it functions similarly to a script within the engine. Examples of this can be seen below.
<br><b>.IRR [Text]</b> - IRR files contain XML and function the same way as stated above.
<br><b>.OBJ [Model]</b> - Wavefront .OBJ is a model filetype. These models **do not support animations or <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/introduction.html>armatures</a> (skeletons)**. For this reason, these models are often used for props, accessories, and terrain in Bugsnax as they **only contain <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/index.html>mesh</a> data**.
<br><b>.X [Model]</b> - DirectX .X is a model filetype. These models **do support animations and armatures** and are therefore used for animating both Grumpus and Bugsnak NPCs. 
<br><b>.DAE [Model]</b> - Collada .DAE files are an XML-based model format. These files are used infrequently throughout Bugsnax for models such as leaves.
<br><b>.DDS [Texture]</b> - DirectDraw Surface .DDS files are a texture filetype used to texture models in Bugsnax. They support <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/texture-filtering-with-mipmaps>mipmaps</a> which allow the texture to change quality the closer/further you are from it to optimise rendering.
<br><b>.PNG [Texture]</b> - .PNG files are a very common image format that _can_ be used to texture any model in the game and are used to texture the UI within the game. These do not support mipmaps.
